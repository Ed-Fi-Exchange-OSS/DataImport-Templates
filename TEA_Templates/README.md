# Texas Education Agency Finance and Human Resources DataImport Template

## Overview

These Ed-Fi Data Import templates are created for the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to import data into TEA's Ed-Fi ODS, specifically for the finance and human resources domains. The templates are available for multiple Texas Education Data Standard versions.

Please check the [DataImport User Guide](<DataImport User Guide.pdf>) if you need help configuring Data Import using an existing template to load data into the Ed-Fi ODS.

Additional documentation is available in each subfolder. Sample files for each version are located in the "sampleFiles" folderâ€”just add your data.


## Important Usage Note

Ensure compatibility by using the correct template version according to your system's API version and data needs. You can find TEA resource definitions. ([TEA resources](https://www.texasstudentdatasystem.org/tsds/about/resources))
