# Data Import

## Overview

The Data Import tool allows users to define templates, which map data sources to an Ed-Fi ODS / API. The Ed-Fi Template Sharing Service provides users of the Data Import tool the ability to share templates with other organizations using import and export features built in to the tool.

Data Import templates have been submitted by other Ed-Fi community members based on actual implementations.

## Important Usage Note

Shared templates provide a significant head start to mapping source data for import. However, Ed-Fi ODS / API instances can be customized, and source data formats often change from implementation to implementation (even within the same product version). So, these templates can save you time with Data Import setup but are NOT intended as a definitive or canonical mapping for source data.  

When using Data Import templates you've imported from other organizations, always review carefully to ensure that the template components — that is, the maps, lookups, and bootstraps — match your scenario, source data, and Ed-Fi ODS / API configuration. You will often need to make modifications to imported templates to fit the needs of your specific implementation.  Please use these templates with caution and ensure they are fully reviewed for your implementation before putting to use.
